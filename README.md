# Typescript Boilerplate with Webpack Frontend
- A simple boilerplate that unites typescript node backend with
webpack's frontend.
- The frontend uses pure html and css tricks, but you can use your
favourite libs or frameworks.
- The best lint and code styling tools are included in this projetc.
For lint choose Eslint, and it's very important to use ESlint vscode
extension. Is for code styling choose Prettier, and just like in
Eslint, use a VSCode extension that has the same name(Prettier).
